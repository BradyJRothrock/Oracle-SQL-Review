## Oracle Cloud Free Tier for Education Setup

Students in this course will be using Oracle Cloud Free Tier Account for Education. This cloud service provides Free Oracle Autonomous Database instances that will be used in class. Additionally, once registered you get 365 days and $300 free money to use on Paid Cloud Services that will also be used in class. Please note that this Free Tier is different from the Normal Oracle Free Tier in that you are not required to provide a credit card and you have 365 days instead of 30 days of use for non-free services.

If you have not registered for your Oracle Free Tier for Education account yet proceed to Part 1.
